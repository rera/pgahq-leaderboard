# Changelog

### 2019-05-22
### Changed
- Refactored to use function components rather than class
- Implemented hooks where appropriate, e.g.: useState, useEffect, useContext
- Most tests breaking currently because Enzyme doesn't support testing Hooks.

### Todo
- Maybe swap out `enzyme` for `react-testing-library` and rewrite tests
